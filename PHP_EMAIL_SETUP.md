2. Make sure the file is accessible at `https://vonsit.com/send-quote.php`

### Step 2: Test the Setup
1. Fill out your contact form on the website
2. Check your email at `von@vonsit.com`
3. You should receive an email with the form data

### Step 3: Optional - Customize Email Settings
In `send-quote.php`, you can modify:

```php
// Change the "From" address (line 42)
'From: noreply@vonsit.com',  // Change to any @vonsit.com address

// Change the email subject format (line 35)
$subject = "New Quote Request from " . $name;

// Customize the email content (lines 38-50)
$message = "Your custom email template here...";
```
